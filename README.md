# test showcase

In order to run the tests, you'll need to install the rust nightly toolchain.

If you don't already have rustup, the toolchain manager for rust, follow the instructions [here](https://rustup.rs/).

```bash
# Install nightly
rustup toolchain install nightly
```

Run the benchmarks with

```bash
rustup run nightly cargo bench
```
